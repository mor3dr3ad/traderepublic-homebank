# traderepublic-homebank
Small script to extract a csv file from other_events.json generated by pytr: https://github.com/pytr-org/pytr

I use this to translate the transactions under the other_events.json file into homebank, the personal accounting software I use. 

The tool puts translates  all transactions except failed ones and purchases of stocks/ETFs (I track these using Portfolio Performance via PDF import, so no need to double (ac)count)

Should be fairly easy to adapt to your needs. 

TODO:
- Write function for duration, e.g. last 180 days or so
- Extract more useful info from weird nested JSON data under details.section

Usage:
- python pytrToCsv.py <input_file> <output_file>
